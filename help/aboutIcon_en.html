<p>The background represents the three coloured flag of the Netherlands.
The plugin is especially targetted for use inside the Netherlands.<br>
The Netherlands has maybe the most advanced warning system in the
world to protect their underground Infrastructure.
<p>On the foreground you can see the bucket of excevating machine representing
mechanical digging.</p>
<p>By law, before any mechanical digging is done in the Netherlands, first
information on the infrastructure underground has to be aqcuired and viewed
carefully. This viewer helps to prevent damage by giving a clear picture that
can be compared (by loading) the necessary excavation work according design.

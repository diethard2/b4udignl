<title>Wion Result viewer - How to use</title>
</head>
<body>

<H1>How to use</H1>
<p>First you need to know how to obtain the result of a Dutch Dig alert. 
From here I use Wion Result when I refer to this result of a Dutch Dig Alert. 
How to obtain it is explained in <a href="aboutWion_en.html">About WION</a>.
After you downloaded the result you will have a zip-archive. 
You have to extract the contents first in a directory.</p>

<p>The Wion Result Viewer has three tabs, <B>Messages</B>,<B>Themes</B> and <B>Options</B>.
The viewer, allways starts with the open tab <B>Messages</B>, because the 
first thing you have to do is open a Wion Message.</p>  
<p>When the contents of received zip-archive is extracted to a directory, 
you can use the button <B>[Open Directory...]</B> to select this directory 
holding the Wion Result.<BR>
It is recommended to first set the default Directory in tab <B>Options</B> so searching starts in selected directory where Wion messages are expected to be found.<BR>
After selection and pressing [OK] this is what will happen:
<ul>
<li>The xml file of Wion result is read which holds information on the other 
included files in the Wion Alert</li>
<li>Next to all images that will be loaded as layers, little files will 
be created, called world files, to give those images a coordinate system and in 
fact turning images into maps.</li>
<li>The legend groups Annotation, Dimensioning, Location, and Background topo 
are created in QGIS in the layer panel (not in QGIS 1.6.0).</li>
<li>The maps are loaded in the right order as layers into QGIS and placed 
in the right legend group.</li>
<li>The registration number of this Wion result is added to the list of loaded 
Wion Results.</li>
<li>Also the documents that come with the maps, being PDF files, are sorted out 
and placed in a list of included files.</li> 
<li>In the tab <B>Themes</B> included themes in the Wion Result become 
clearly visible.</li>
</ul>
Be aware that a Wion Result can include many files and processing can 
take some time.</p> 

<P>Before loading, you can first extract the zipfile holding the Wion result 
yourself, but you can also use the button <B>[Open Zipfile...]</B> or use Alt-Z.<BR>
This Function first extracts the zipfile and then loads the Wion Result in 
QGIS. You should use this function only once for every Wion result, the next 
time it is faster to use [Open Folder...] instead.
</p>
<p>When the list with PDF files is filled you can select and open them using 
<B>[Open file(s)]</B>. When you select multiple PDF files or use Ctrl-A to select  
them all, you can also open several pdf files at once. 
Double clicking a file in the list of PDF files opens it directly. 
</p>
<p>You can load and work with more Wion results. 
After loading another wion result, you can select this result in the list of 
Wion results. After selection the list of accompanying documents is refreshed 
with the ones belonging to that Wion Result.<BR>
You can use the button <B>[Goto]</B> or Alt-B to move the map in QGIS to the extent 
of selected Wion result.<BR>
To get the best view of the Wion Result use the button <B>[Best Scale]</B> 
or Alt-B. 
Use the button <B>[Close Message]</B>, Alt-C to close selected Wion Message. 
</p>
<p>You can store all information in Wion Result Viewer plugin in a project using the
button <B>[Save in project]</B>. This only works when you first have created
a project, use the option <B>Save project</B> from the <B>File</B> menu. 
Then the next time you open a project the contents of the plugin is restored.
</p>
<p>Use the button <B>[Quit]</B>, Alt-Q or using the [Esc]-button on your keyboard 
to close the Wion Result Viewer. When you open the Wion Result Viewer again 
you will find it in the same state as when you closed it.</p>

<p>After loading, all layers are visible, you can make layers invisible by 
deselecting the little cross, used to mark the visibility, in front of each layer 
or several layers for a whole group (for QGIS1.6.0 only from Themes tab).<BR>
<p>It is also possible to set visibilities using the <B>Themes</B> tab.</p>

<p>The first two characters followed by an underscore of each layer 
indicate what kind of layer it concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li><B>AN_</B> means annotation, and is used to label pipelines, cables etc.</li>
<li><B>MV_</B> holds the dimensioning, the marked distances between pipes
and buildings for example.</li>
<li><B>LG_</B> holds the position of the pipelines and cables themselves.</li>
<li><B>GB_</B> holds the background topography provided by Kadaster,
the outlines of houses, roads etc.</li>
<li><B>PT_</B> and <B>ET_</B> hold addition background topography
which can be delivered by the netowners.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>The tab <B>Themes</B> shows which Wion themes the selected Wion Result 
contains. It is also a legend of the map. 
For example the green lines are used to show the position of cables 
on the map that convey data. The visibility can be changed for 
active available themes. A theme includes the position, annotation and 
dimensioning of a cable/pipe. 
Special themes have also been added to turn on/of the visibility for all
layers that contain only annotation, dimensioning, location or topo.</p>
<p>Use the button [Refresh] Alt-R to refresh the contents of the 
<B>Themes</B> tab. Use this button when you did not change the visibility 
of layers from the Wion Result Viewer, but directly in QGIS Layers panel. 
In that case the Themes may not correspond anymore with the actual situation
in the map. A refresh can in that case be done manually.</p>

<P>A checkbox of a theme and a group in the layers panel can have three
statusses with respect to layers belonging to that theme or group.
<ol>
<li>an empty checkbox, no layers are visible</li>
<li>A checkbox with a grey cross, some layers are visible </li>
<li>A checkbox with a black cross, all layers are visible</li>
</ol>

<H2>Question and Answers</H2>
<P>Question: Why is the list of PDF documents empty after opening a saved project?<BR>
Answer: Use the button <B>Save in project</B> to retain the state of
plugin in the project.</P>
<P>Question: Is it possible to load more Wion Results?<BR>
Answer: Yes you can, only when they do overlap remember that the
topography layer delivered by Kadaster (the one starting with GB_)
is not transparant. So you better move that layer to the bottom of the
list with layers.
</P>
<P>Question: Why are In QGIS 1.6.0 the legend groups missing?<BR>
Answer: There is a problem in version 1.6.0 with adding legend groups so
they could not be used, in 1.5.0 they still are there and I expect in 1.7.0
the layer groups will also be available again.</P>
<P>Question: How can I load a design drawing from Autocad?<BR>
Answer: QGIS1.6.0 uses GDAL1.7.0 which allows you to load autocad dxf as
a layer.</P>
                    

<H2>Error messages</h2>
<p>When a directory is selected that holds no (valid) Wion result, you will get following error message:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Selected directory does not contain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of Dutch Dig Alert or it can not be read!
</i><BR>
In that case often there is a folder underneath selected folder that does contain a valid Wion Result.

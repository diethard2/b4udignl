<H1>About Wion</H1>

<H2>General</H2>
<p>In the Netherlands mechanical digging is only allowed according the law WION.
The purpose of this law it to bring back the amount of damage caused by 
digging that could have been prevented when information about pipes and 
cables was available in one map together with guiding drawings and letters.
The law WION has helped to establish a framework for optimal exchange of
information between the ones who dig and the netowners. To enforce the law,
steep penalty fees have to be paid when digger failed to request information
or netowner failed to provide requested information!</p>

<H2>History</H2>
<p>Netowners have tried for a very long time to protect their underground
network. The netowners organised themselves and agreed to provide free
information to building companies. A central non-profit organisation was born
called KLIC. Building companies could provide a dig alert to KLIC, KLIC
informed the netowners, the netowners provided the building companies with
information directly.</P>
<p>Although a dig alert was not neccesary then, insurance companies demanded
building companies to do so. Less damage meant lower insurance fees, but failing
to do a dig alert means damage was not well insured anymore!<BR> 
The growing amount of information received by the contractor was often hard
to interprete and the contractor needed more time to merge this information 
to one clear picture. Sometimes digging commenced without consulting all
received information first.</p>

<H2>The law WION</H2>
<p>When the law WION came into force, things changed a bit. Mechanical digging
was absolutely not allowed anymore without doing first a dig alert with
Kadaster. Penalty fees are steep (ten thousands of euro's). A dig alert is not
free anymore, a dig alert costs 24 euro (july 2010).
The kadaster now collects information from all network owners and the result
is returned as layers of maps with network information together with guiding
letters and drawings. The layers can be combined into one clear picture.
This information can be viewed from inside a free viewer provided by 
Kadaster, but even better from QGIS using the Wion Result Viewer.

<H2>3 kinds of requests</H2>
<p>
Three kinds of requests can be made, each of them serve a special purpose.
<ol>
    <li>Digging alert: Three days before digging takes place, this should
    be requested. A digging alert is only valid for 21 days</li>
    <li>Calamity alert: When a cable or pipe is broken a calamity alert has to
    be done. The information helps to prevent further damage and personal
    injuries.</li>
    <li>Orientation request: For other purposes like design an orientation
    request can be done. Mechanical digging can not be done using this
    kind of request!</li>
</ol>                                  

<H2>Doing a Dig Alert request</H2>
<p>The website www.kadaster.nl/klic gives information how to do a Dig Alert
request. For companies there is the web service KLIC-online that can be used
to do a Dig Alert, registration is necessary. Using KLIC-online you can draw
the planned area inside an interactive map, where you want to excavate.
Private persons can fill in a form to obtain information.</p>
<p>Within a day you will receive an email with an url where you can download
requested information. Be carefull to download this information first without
opening it directly. You have only 5 attempts to receive requested information.
After downloading the information unpack it and view it using the Wion Result
Viewer</p>
<p>For testing purposes, you can also download one of the two free example
digging requests from www.klicviewer.nl<p>
